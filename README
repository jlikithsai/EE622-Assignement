/* Coherent detection in Rayleigh flat fading channels. MIMO systems.
/******************************************************************************/

This is a C code for coherent detection of M-ary constellations in fading
channels.

Operating system required:
--------------------------
Linux.

Brief description of various files:
-----------------------------------

mimomake        : Required to compile the code.
                  Input: All the source files.
                  Output: Executable file called "mimo".
mimotype.h      : Contains all the definitions.
mimoglob.h      : All the global variables are defined here. This file is to
                  be included in the file containing "main()".
mimoext.h       : Same as "mimoglob.h". This file is to be included in all
                  the other C files.
mimofunctions.h : Function declarations.
mimomain.c      : Contains "main()".
mimopre.c       : Pre-precessor routines.
mimock.c        : Checks for errors in the definitions.
mimoinit.c      : Initialization routines.
mimoutil.c      : Utility routines like Gaussian noise generation.
mimosim.c       : Simulation routines.
mimosym.c       : Symbol generation routines.
mimomap.c       : Maps bits to symbols.
mimopost.c      : Post-processor.

This code uses some built-in functions like "random()", "erand48()".
You can know more about these functions by typing the following at the
command prompt:

man erand48

"man" denotes manual pages.

Compiling and running the code:
-------------------------------

To compile the code type the following in the command prompt:

make -f mimomake

The executable file called "mimo" will be created.

To run the code type:

time mimo > tmp &

The "time" command tells how much time the code
takes to run. "mimo" is the executable file.
"> tmp" redirects the output to a file called "tmp".
"&" is used to run the program in the background.
